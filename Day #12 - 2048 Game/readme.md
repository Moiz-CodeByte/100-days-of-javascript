## Introduction
The **2048 Game** is a classic sliding puzzle game implemented as a web application. The objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the value of 2048. The game features a clean, responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features
- Slide tiles in four directions using keyboard arrows or touch swipes
- Merge tiles with the same number to create higher-value tiles
- Score tracking as you progress through the game
- Responsive design with optimized mobile experience
- Attractive user interface with color-coded tiles
- User-friendly game over modal with the option to restart
- Touch support with swipe gestures for mobile devices
